The phenotype of interest, $Y$, is a binary trait measured for $N$ unrelated individuals generated based on the liability threshold model. 

For individuals who develop the trait, there are two possible models their age of onset could be drawn from.

1. age-of-onset follows a truncated Gaussian distribution with the truncation occurring at $\Phi^{-1}(0.025)$ and $\Phi^{-1}(0.975)$ quantiles.

2. age-of-onset follows a logistic function based on the liability


For individuals who do not develop the disease, their age of censoring (e.g. age when interviewed) follows a truncated Gaussian distribution with truncation occurring at $\Phi^{-1}(0.025)$ and $\Phi^{-1}(0.975)$ quantiles. It can be thought as though everyone has a censoring/interview age that follows this distribution, but the age-of-onset is fully observed for all cases (i.e. precedes their age of censoring).
