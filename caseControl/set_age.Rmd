```{r, size = 'small'}

# Set age-of-onset and age-at-censoring
# Age-of-onset is set based on user input/liability
# If choice==1, Age-at-censoring same range as age-of-onset
# If choice==2, Age-at-censoring based on user input
# Returns: age-of-onset or age-at-censoring for each person

## Variables:
## Y: case-control status
## liability: continuous liability
## choice: choose between two parameters (1==unobs, 2==min/maxCen)
## K: population proportion of cases
## P: sample proportion of cases (1== P=K, 2== P=50%)
## minOnset: min age-of-onset
## maxOnset: max age-of-onset
## minCen: min age-at-censoring (not used with unobs)
## maxCen: max age-at-censoring (not used with unobs)
## info: liability informs age-of-onset (1==no, 2==yes)
