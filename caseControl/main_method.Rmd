```{r, size = 'small'}

# Simulate under liability threshold model for case-control status
# Age-of-onset is set based on user input/liability
# Age-at-censoring if unobserved samples is same as distribution as age-of-onset
# If all cases are observed age-at-censoring is set by user
# Returns: case-control status, age, liability, genetic liability, GRM,  genetic liability deciles

## Variables:
## N: number of individuals
## M: number of SNPs
## h2: SNP heritability
## C: proportion of causal SNPs
## choice: choose between two parameters (1==unobs, 2==min/maxCen)
## K: population proportion of cases
## P: sample proportion of cases (1==P=K, 2==P=50%)
## ageDist: distribution for age-of-onset/censoring (1==logistic; 2==Gaussian)
## minOnset: min age-of-onset
## maxOnset: max age-of-onset
## unobs: proportion of "true" cases who are unobserved (i.e. censored)
## minCen: min age-at-censoring (not used with unobs)
## maxCen: max age-at-censoring (not used with unobs)
## info: liability informs age-of-onset (1==no, 2==yes)
