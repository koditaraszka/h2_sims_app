title: "Continuous Liability: Quick Description"

---
The phenotype of interest, $l$, is a quantitative trait for $N$ unrelated individuals. This can be thought of as the continuous liability that is traditionally not observed in the liability threshold model.

We will assume everyone is a case and that there are two possible models their age of onset could be drawn from.

1. age-of-onset follows a truncated Gaussian distribution with the truncation occurring at $\Phi^{-1}(0.025)$ and $\Phi^{-1}(0.975)$ quantiles.
  
2. age-of-onset follows a logistic function based on the liability

We can allow a subset of individuals to be censored before their age-of-onset (i.e are controls)

The assumed distribution of age-at-censoring will follow the same distribution as age-of-onset but be mean shifted such that the censoring rate is maintained
