```{r, size = 'small'}

# Simulate a parametric survival model according to Weibull distribution
# Age-of-onset is set based on user input/liability
# Age-at-censoring either fixed at max age
# Or age-at-censoring is simulated under independent Weibull distribution
# Returns: case-control status, age, liability, genetic liability, GRM,  genetic liability deciles

## Variables:
## N: number of individuals
## M: number of SNPs
## h2: SNP heritability
## C: proportion of causal SNPs
## K: population proportion of cases
## P: sample proportion of cases (1==P=K, 2==P=50%)
## minOnset: min age-of-onset
## maxOnset: max age-of-onset
## cen: how to censor (1==set censoring age to max age, 2== simulate censoring age)
## shape: shape parameter for Weibull distribution
## info: liability informs age-of-onset (1==no, 2==yes)
