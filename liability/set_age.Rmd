```{r, size = 'small'}

# Set age-of-onset and age-at-censoring
# Age-of-onset is set based on user input
# controls only due to censoring
# Age-of-censoring has same variance as age-of-onset
# Age-of-censoring is then mean shifted to return correct censoring rate
# Returns: age-of-onset and age-at-censoring

## Variables:
## N: number of individuals
## liability: continuous liability 
## ageDist: distribution for age-of-onset/censoring (1==logistic; 2==Gaussian)
## minOnset: min age-of-onset
## maxOnset: max age-of-onset
## cenRate: proportion of individuals censored
## info: liability informs age-of-onset (1==no, 2==yes)
