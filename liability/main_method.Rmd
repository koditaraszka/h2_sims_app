```{r, size = 'small'}

# Simulate under continuous liability model where everyone is a case
# Age-of-onset is set based on user input/liability
# controls only due to censoring
# Age-of-censoring has same variance as age-of-onset
# Age-of-censoring is then mean shifted to return correct censoring rate
# Returns: case-control status, age, liability, genetic liability, GRM,  genetic liability deciles

## Variables:
## N: number of individuals
## M: number of SNPs
## h2: SNP heritability
## C: proportion of causal SNPs
## ageDist: distribution for age-of-onset/censoring (1==logistic; 2==Gaussian)
## minOnset: min age-of-onset
## maxOnset: max age-of-onset
## cenRate: proportion of individuals censored
## info: liability informs age-of-onset (1==no, 2==yes)

liability = function(N, M, h2, C, ageDist, minOnset, maxOnset, cenRate, info){

  MAF=0.05
  # helper function for genetic liability
  # returns: genetic liability and GRM
  gen = gen_liab(N, M, C, h2, MAF)

  l_g = gen$liab
  cuts = quantile(l_g,probs = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1))
  
  l_e = sqrt(1-h2)*scale(rnorm(N, 0, 1))
  l = l_g + l_e

  # helper function which returns age-of-onset and age-at-censoring
  # returns: age-of-onset and age-at-censoring
  age = setage_liability(N, l, ageDist, minOnset, maxOnset, cenRate, info)

  # indicator (Y=1 age-of-onset observed, Y=0, age-of-onset is censored)
  Y = as.numeric(age$onset<=age$censor)
  age <- pmin(age$onset, age$censor)

  return(list("Y"=Y, "age"=round(age, 1), "liab"=l, "gen"=l_g, "GRM"=gen$GRM, "cuts" = cuts))
